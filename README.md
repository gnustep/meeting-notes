# meeting-notes
This repo will contain any and all documents which contain decisions or information relevant to GNUstep administrative meetings.

This will not include anything discussed on the mailing list.  I will make note of such discussions here:
1. There was a discussion in november about "Missing ObjC2.0 features in gcc" where some significant discussion occurred
2. A later email gave until 11/27/2020 for gcc to improve
   a. We will contact the gcc developers to see if there is interest in adding these features.
